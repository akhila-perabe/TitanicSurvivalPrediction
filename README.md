# TitanicSurvivalPrediction

This project predicts the survival of a passenger in the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning model.


The dataset provided has the following information:

    PassengerId : Passenger Id
    Survived    : Whether the passenger survived or not (0/1)
    Pclass      : Ticket Class (1/2/3)
    Name        : Name of the passenger
    Sex         : Male / Female
    Age         : Age of Passenger
    SibSp       : Number of siblings / spouses travelling along
    Parch       : Number of parents / children travelling along
    Ticket      : Ticket Number
    Fare        : Ticket fare
    Cabin       : Cabin Number
    Embarked    : Embarked Port (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)


The prediction system here is based on Neural Network model, implemented using MLPClassifier from scikit-learn python package.
